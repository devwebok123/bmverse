              The theory of the savior generation, which directly refers to all
              the netizens and is called the generation Z as a provider for the
              growth of the alpha generation and their guide, has focused
              totally on game development, which apart from entertainment and
              creating an exciting atmosphere, seeks to make It as a platform to
              take creativity and reaching 100% of human abilities.
              <br />
              The first step, to take so, is to dominate decentralization in a
              radical way on the Alpha generation. Game making is our first
              action by which We will show the alpha generation that man is a
              creator And not just a consumer.

              This evolution needs a platform that each generation takes from
              the previous generation. We explained in detail about the
              generation of the Savior and how it was formed in an article, and
              it is mentioned that the alpha generation needs a decentralized
              platform to implement social justice. The task of providing the
              prerequisites and teaching the Alpha generation to benefit from
              all the potentials of a decentralized platform is the
              responsibility of the generation Z. Therefore, generation Z can be
              called the prerequisites’ provider, and generation Alpha can be
              called the generation of the Saviors and residents of a
              justice-oriented society in which %100 of people’s abilities are
              used.
