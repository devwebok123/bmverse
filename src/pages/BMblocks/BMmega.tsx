                  Mutant Ants of the Mega Collection were actually made for the
                  development of video games, and all of them were individually
                  converted into NFTs, creating a unique and professional
                  collection. On the other hand, the features and capabilities
                  of these characters have also become NFT and are tradable.
                  Even the cards that enhance the abilities of the characters
                  (known as Magical Potion) are works of art that have no
                  equivalent in the real world and are offered in NFT format.

                Activating the third ability of each character requires its
                owner’s taste and expertise. The third ability is activated only
                if the character is developed by its owner. This development
                includes a change in the appearance or a special improvement in
                the characteristics by using coding and so on. After receiving
                the third ability of each character, you will actually have
